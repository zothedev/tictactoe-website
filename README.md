# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**[Click to view website](https://zothedev.github.io/tictactoe-website/)**

This project shows off my ability to create objects, functions, and manipulate the dom 
in javascript. Additionally, I displayed the site using CSS Grid and Flexbox. 

I used factory functions to organize my code. 3 of my 4 factories were inside an IIFE (module pattern), tucking away
code that does not need to be in the global space. This allows these factories to not be reused to create additional
instances. Every piece of functionality fits under the gameBoard, gameFlow, player, and displayController objects. 
This project required me to think logically about where to house each function. 

This game includes:
- player name change functionality
- multiple rounds of play
- win tracker displays for each player
- current player and game over display, under the board
